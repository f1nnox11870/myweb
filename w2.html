                    <p class="blog-post_text">
                        Decision intelligence supports nuanced decision-making at every level  strategic, operational, and tactical - to provide confidence in tools such as artificial intelligence that help automate businesses and enable faster, more accurate decisions.

Decision intelligence improves decision-making by understanding how decisions are made, and how outcomes are evaluated, managed, and improved through deeper insights.

Context plus confidence: It's this combination that gives you data with meaning, supports your decisions, and builds lower-cost business resiliency.

Decision intelligence is the latest step in the evolution of business intelligence. Instead of combining all available data, context-free, and presenting it to a decision-maker, decision intelligence uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide a single analytical view - to either fully automate decisions or to help data professionals make faster, more accurate decisions through augmentation.

                    <p class="blog-post_text">
                        As Gartner notes, decision-making competency can be a significant source of competitive advantage. Gartner predicts that by 2024, one-third of large organizations will use decision intelligence for structured decision-making to improve competitive advantage and optimize efficiency. Decision intelligence was also named one of Gartner's top strategic technology trends for 2022.

Using artificial intelligence, decision intelligence unlocks the power of entity resolution and graph analytics to turn data into accurate decisions at scale. This means that data becomes more than the sum of its parts - not piecemeal, siloed, and afflicted with poor quality. Entity resolution connects all data from previously siloed and scattered points, and creates a single, trusted, connected, and reusable resource.

                    <h1 class="blog-post_title">How does decision intelligence use artificial intelligence?</h1>
                    <p class="blog-post_text">
                        In today's fast-paced business world, decision-makers are often under intense pressure to make fact-based, consistent decisions in a hurry. This is why enterprises turn to technologies such as AI and machine learning (ML) to augment their decision-making capabilities.

                        The problem is that organizations often deploy these technologies without fully understanding the importance of placing the data they collect in context to gain the bigger picture of what data is being collected and how it is being applied to the decision-making process. Without context, AI predictions lack dependability, opening the door to a wide range of long-term automation challenges and other setbacks that can sink profits.
                        
                        Entity resolution is what gives data context by connecting billions of data points spread across multiple systems into a single, accurate view that reflects the real-world connections between people, places, and organizations to create a single source of truth.
                        
                        When it comes to employing AI and ML as part of the decision-making process, the quality of the data you use is everything. This is why data scientists are so tightly focused on using reliable, transparent data to make the best algorithms possible.

                    <p class="blog-post_text">
                        Decision intelligence platforms employ a new generation of software designed to automate or augment processes - empowering operational teams to make faster and more accurate strategic, tactical, and operational decisions.
                        By utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, these platforms connect billions of data points across internal and external data sources to provide a trusted and reusable data hub enriched with vital intelligence about the graph of relationships between real-world entities such as: people, organizations, events, and places.

                    <p class="blog-post_text">
                        Before the advent of decision intelligence to bring data together, data was often scattered across systems, siloed, incomplete, or of such poor quality that it was difficult to make connections. This often led to poor or wrong decisions that hurt the customer experience and lost revenue.

Today, decision intelligence provides the means to harness this fragmented data to provide a holistic, trusted view of B2C and B2B customers, allowing decision-makers and analysts to uncover hidden patterns that were previously unseeable to dramatically increase the value of insights.
